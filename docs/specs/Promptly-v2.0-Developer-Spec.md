## KnowledgeCore Integration

### 1. Purpose
Zaza Promptly integrates with **KnowledgeCore**, Zaza’s shared AI memory and retrieval infrastructure. KnowledgeCore provides persistent context across messages, sessions, and apps, ensuring that Promptly is not just a message generator but a communication continuity engine.

### 2. Core Integration Points

#### 2.1 Message Memory & Continuity
**Priority: P0**
- Store all drafts, finalised parent messages, tone rewrites, and translations in KnowledgeCore.
- Allow Zara to reference prior exchanges when suggesting tone, phrasing, or follow-up lines.
- Example: If a teacher wrote about a student’s late homework last week, Zara will surface that context in today’s communication.

#### 2.2 Cross-App Context Sharing
**Priority: P0**
- Make parent communication data in Promptly available in **Inbox** for continuity.
- Flow professional insights (communication style, responsiveness, outcomes) into **Coach** for teacher development.
- Allow Promptly-created templates and closing lines to be reused in **Teach**.

#### 2.3 Professional Portfolio & Attribution
**Priority: P1**
- Tag each message with metadata (student, topic, tone, timestamp).
- Enable anonymised communication history export for professional portfolios.
- Contribute attribution data to teacher achievements inside the Zaza ecosystem.

#### 2.4 Search & Retrieval
**Priority: P1**
- Provide search of past messages within Promptly.
- Handle queries via KnowledgeCore’s semantic search and metadata filters.
- Example: “Find all notes I sent about behaviour issues in Term 1.”

#### 2.5 Compliance & Privacy
**Priority: P0**
- Route sensitive student/parent data through KnowledgeCore’s compliance layer (GDPR/FERPA).
- Apply PII redaction and anonymisation before exposing data to other apps.
- Provide user controls: *Forget Message* and *Download My Data*.

### 3. Technical Notes
- **APIs:** Promptly must call KnowledgeCore APIs for ingestion, retrieval, and metadata tagging.
- **Data Models:** Messages stored with fields for sender, audience, topic, tone, sentiment, and timestamp.
- **Storage:** Supabase vector DB for embeddings; Firestore for lightweight metadata queries.
- **Indexing:** Content embedded via OpenAI/Claude API and stored in KnowledgeCore’s retrieval layer.
- **Security:** Encrypted at rest; role-based access enforced across apps.

### 4. Example Flow
1. Teacher drafts a rough parent note in Promptly.
2. Comment Agent rewrites → final draft stored in KnowledgeCore.
3. Next week, Zara references the stored message for continuity.
4. Parent communication history is visible in Inbox for ongoing relationships.
5. Coach surfaces anonymised insights as part of teacher growth tracking.
